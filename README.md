# ld37-digestion-manager
"One room" theme game made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 37

You are the digestion manager inside of Taylor, your average American teenager. Your job is to help Taylor’s stomach adjust to unhealthy or unusual diets. Everything that is consumed can impact energy, happiness, and digestive health.  YOU MUST ENSURE THAT NEITHER HAPPINESS NOR ENERGY REACH 0 OR TAYLOR WILL DIE.


The brain will communicate each day’s schedule to you so you know what activities Taylor has planned. 


DECIDE WHAT TO FULLY DIGEST (IN ORDER TO GET THE FULL BENEFIT / PENALTY FROM THE FOOD) AND WHAT TO SEND STRAIGHT THROUGH TO WASTE MANAGEMENT (THIS WILL REDUCE THE BENEFIT / PENALTY OF THE FOOD). 


USE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UPCOMING SCHEDULE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PRIORITIZE ENERGY, HAPPINESS, OR DIGESTIVE HEALTH.


Keep in mind: 
 - Each activity has a type. Hover over an activity type icon for information about that type. 
 - Having indigestion while staying home is far less risky than when going out with friends.


Remember, you can only work with what Taylor chooses to consume! Do your best!

NOTE: Plays best on Chrome v55 in full screen on a 1920x1080p monitor.
